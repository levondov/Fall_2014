// a blackjack (a total of 21). ResultOfPlay returns the result of playing
// the hand. 
// First, the customer draws cards until he/she either goes past 21 (a "bust") 
// or reaches a suitable total less than or equal to 21. If the customer has 
// not bust, then the dealer draws cards until reaching a total of 17 or more. 
// ResultOfPlay returns 0 if the customer busts or if the customer's total is 
// less than or equal to the dealer's and the dealer hasn't bust. 
// ResultOfPlay returns 1 if the dealer busts or if the customer's total 
// exceeds the dealer's and the customer has not bust.
// ResultOfPlay should also print appropriate debugging output.
