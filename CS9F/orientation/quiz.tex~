\normalsize 2. Briefly explain your strategy for doing your course work this semester. For

finish the bulk of your work has proven to be an unsuccessful strategy for
passing our courses \\

\textbf{I plan allocate certain days of the week to work on this course just like I would with any other course. I do not plan to finish everything the last few weeks of the semester, but will work on assignments and quizzes at a normal pace similiar to the way 'normal classes' work.} \\
