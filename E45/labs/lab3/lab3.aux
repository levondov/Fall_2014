The thermocouple tip rests in a small depression in the top of the sample, which is suspended by a Nichrome wire. Inset shows crucial alignment of sample with the rectangular slot at the bottom of the furnace. At right the sample is lowered into the water, submerged 1/8 inch, to establish temperature gradient ($900\degree $C at top) and held for 15 minutes before quenching. It may be necessary to replenish the water supply due to evaporative losses. [2]}}{1}}

When the sample is released, the probe is also released from inside the brass sample and exposed to the coils directly, resulting in a spike in temperature.}}{3}}
