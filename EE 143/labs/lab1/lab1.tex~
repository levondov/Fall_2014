\section{Process Procedures}
\subsection{Process Monitoring Measurements}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Measurement Type and Description}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Describe monitoring measurements that were done during processing:} \\

\textbf{Film color} - 
Film color was used during etching processes. In order to determine wheather a layer had finished etching, we used visual queues by paying attention to the color change on the films. e.g. we know aluminum etch will have finished once the silver metalish color disappeared on the wafer. \\
 
\textbf{Line Width} - 
The width of 2 um lines were measured after photolithography and after etching and PR removal to determine the amount of overetch that occured for a given layer. \\

\textbf{Thickness} -
The nanospec machine in the lab is used to measure film thicknesses. This can be done directly on our wafers or can be done on control wafers. We use control wafers in the process to measure certain film thicknesses as well as resistivities. \\

\textbf{Resistivity} - 
A four-point probe was used to measure the sheet resistance of the control wafer to monitor diffusion effects on doping concentration. \\

\textbf{Vernier} - 
Interlocking bars with slightly different spacing were produced by aligning the alignment keys of different mask layers. The offset of the bars allows the offset of the alignment between different layers to be determined very precisely.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Over-Etch/Under-Etch}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Determine whether each layer was overetched or underetched? Did you purposely
over/underetch? Why?} \\

\textbf{Field Oxide} - Overetched. This was purposely overetched to ensure process latitude. \\
\textbf{Polysilicon} - Overetched.  This was overetched in order to ensure process latitude. \\
\textbf{Gate Oxide} - Overetched. This was overetched in order to keep the source/drain clear. \\
\textbf{Intermed Oxide} - Overetched. This is because we want to make sure our contact holes are open before metalization. If the contact holes are blocked by oxide, our device will not function. \\
\textbf{Aluminum} - Overetched. This is done so contacts above the source/drain do not touch. 


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Misalignment Tolerance}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Describe how the verniers are used to measure misalignment. Using diagrams may
help. Were any layers misaligned intentionally? For each pair of verniers (ACTVPOLY,
ACTV-CONT, POLY-CONT, CONT-METL), describe how far the marks
may be misaligned in terms of device function. (6 Points)} \\

A vernier system usually looks like the figure below.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (5,5) {\includegraphics[width=225pt]{calcs/vernier1.pdf}};
\draw [red] (5.2,6.6) circle (0.5cm);
\draw [red] (5.9,6.6) -- (9.4,6.6);
\node at (10,6.6) {\textcolor{black}{\Large{start}}};
\draw [red] (5.2,2.8) circle (0.5cm);
\draw [red] (5.9,2.8) -- (9.4,2.8);
\node at (10,2.8) {\textcolor{black}{\Large{stop}}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Typical vernier system.}
\end{figure}
The way vernier systems work is by aligning the square spacings in the middle. For our case, a spacing distance corresponds to 0.2 $\mu$m. Now more than likely the vernier spacing is not going to be perfect (like above), and as a result, you will have to calculate the misalignment by counting the spacings. To calculate the spacing, we start where the alignment between the verniers is perfect, this is circled in the above picture where it says 'start'. Now we count the number of spacings from the starting position until we hit alignment again, this is marked by 'stop' in the figure above. For the figure above, we count 5 spacings between alignment and since each spacing corresponds to 0.2 $\mu$m, this means we have a total misalignment of $0.2*5 = 1\,\mu$m. Now if you know exactly how much misalignment there was for a certain mask, you can repeat this same misalignment intentionally for the next mask in order to have the two masks aligned.\\

The amount of misalignment allowed is different for all four masks. For the first ACTV mask misalignment does not matter because it is the very first mask - assuming of course that all other masks are misaligned purposely to match this first mask. For the second POLY mask, misalignment does matter here. If the mask is misaligned to the point where the gate POLY is no longer on the gate oxide, but rather near/on the field oxide, then this is going to cause the device to not function. The CONT mask is the most important mask and very little misalignment should occur here. You want the mask to be over the source/drain regions and not the poly gate or field oxide regions. Having a misaligned mask here will mean that there is no contact to the source/drain region and will result in a dead device. The final METAL mask can have misalignment. As long as the metal contacts from the source/drain are not touching this should not cause any problems. However if the misalignment is say more than the horizontal length of the gate, then you will have the same metal contact in source/drain which means a dead device.

\subsection{Batch \& Individual Processing Steps}

\textbf{List and concisely describe the possible problems that could have occurred during
the batch fabrication steps.} \\
\textbf{What were the sources of the problems, and how could you avoid them? How do
you expect these deviations to affect the performance/function and cross-section of
the device? List the types of monitoring measurements from Part A taken during
each step (7 Points)} \\

\textbf{W2: Field Oxidation}\\
Batch Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Thermal shock can occur when placing the wafer into the furnace. This can result in broken wafers.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item To solve the thermal shock problem we slowly place the wafer into the furnace at a rate of 1 inch / 10 seconds.
	\end{itemize}
\item Resulting oxide thickness can vary between batches and between wafer to wafer due to subtle environmental differences.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Measured the oxide film thickness to make sure the right amount was grown.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Measurements Taken
\begin{itemize}
\item Measured oxide thickness with Nanospec. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{W3: Field Oxide Cut} \\
Individual Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Failure to fully etch through to silicon will leave poor quality oxide in the active area, which can interfere with the growth of gate oxide. Poor gate oxide will allow current to leak and have a lower dielectric strength.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Overetch performed for process latitude, to ensure etch reaches silicon for the entire wafer.
	\item  Agitate wafer during etch to avoid trapped air bubbles.
	\end{itemize}
\item Keeping the wafer inside a dark/clean box will help shield it from particles in the air.
\end{itemize}
Measurements Taken
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 $\mu$m line widths were recorded before and after etching.
\item Observed de-wetting of silicon from the back of the wafer indicating etch reached hydrophobic silicon surface.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{W4: Gate Oxidation} \\
Batch Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Same possibility of thermal shock as with Field Oxidation
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Push slowly into furnace at 1 in/ 10 sec.
	\end{itemize}
\item Particles, dust, and native oxide on the wafer can lower quality of gate oxide due to impurities. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Clean throroughly with Piranha and HF before oxidation.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Measurements Taken
\begin{itemize}
\item Oxide thickness measured on control wafer.
\item Resistivity measured on control wafer.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{W5: Poly Deposition}
Batch Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Haze and other surface anomalies in the polysilicon can be introduced due to contaminants entering during the LCVD process. This can result in electrical failures and interference with the etching of suceeding layers.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Tight control of deposition process to prevent introduction of contaminants. (Step performed by NanoLab)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Measurements Taken
\begin{itemize}
\item No measurements taken (Step performed by NanoLab)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{W6: Gate Definition} \\
Individual Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Misalignment with the ACTV key could result in misaligned gate. As the first mask to need alignment, this could result in further misalignments when CONT and METL are aligned. Severe misalignments could result in a contact short with the gate.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Aligned to ACTV key as closely as possible and accounted for slight misalignment using Vernier scales.
	\end{itemize}
\item Failure to etch completely through the polysilicon could interfere with further etching through the gate oxide and with S/D diffusion.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Waited for the color of wafer surface to cease changing before ceasing to etch.
	\item Agitated wafer during etch to avoid trapped air bubbles.
	\end{itemize}
\item Failure to etch through the gate oxide in the active area could interfere with later S/D diffusion.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Overetched by 20\% to ensure process latitude.  
	\item Agitated wafer during etch to avoid trapped air bubbles.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Measurements Taken
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 $\mu$m line widths were recorded before and after etching.
\item Vernier bars were recorded after etching.
\item Observed color change of surface as polysilicon layer was etched.
\item Observed de-wetting of backside as gate oxide was etched.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{W7a \& b:  S/D Diffusion and Intermediate Oxidation} \\
Batch Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Using SOG as a diffusion source means that the dose rate is not well controlled and uniformity is poor. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Used control wafers to monitor resistivity as an estimate of dosage.
	\end{itemize}
\item Thermal shock can occur when wafers are placed into the furnace, causing fractures.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Slowly pushed wafers into furnace at 1 in/10 sec.
	\end{itemize}
\item Same problems that occur with prediffusion and oxide growth can occur here. The thickness of the intermediate oxide grown can vary between different batches, which may cause problems later on when etching holes for the contacts.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Used the nanoscope to monitor oxide growth on the control wafer.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Individual Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Uneven coverage of the wafer due to the viscosity of SOG and the topography of the wafer could result in uneven doping throughout the layer. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Visually confirmed even film color post-spinning.
	\end{itemize}
\item Failure to strip the SOG completely could result in a higher dosage in some areas during drive-in, resulting in varying performance of the devices on the wafer
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Watched for wafer to dewet after SOG removal.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Measurements Taken
\begin{itemize}
\item Observed de-wetting of wafer as SOG was removed.
\item Measure oxide thickness with NanoSpec. 
\item Measured resistivity after predeposition and drive-in.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Week 8: Contact Hole Cut} \\
Individual Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Misalignment of CONT mask could result either in a short to the gate (if misaligned right) or a failure to contact silicon (if misaligned left).
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Prioritised alignment to ACTV key as to avoid dual misalignment with the POLY mask that would increase the likelihood of a short to the gate.
	\item Accounted for misalignments with ACTV and POLY using Vernier scales.
	\end{itemize}
\item Failure to etch completely through to silicon surface will result in non-functional devices.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Overetched to ensure contact occurs.
	\item Agitated wafer during etch to avoid trapped air bubbles.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Measurements Taken
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 $\mu$m line widths were recorded before and after etching.
\item Vernier bars were recorded after etching.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Week 9: Metallization} \\
Batch Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Point source deposition creates shadowing and step coverage problems
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Have the wafers rotate in the aluminum pump which would allow for better step coverage.
	\item Have the intermediate oxide sidewalls etched more gradually or have the oxide thickness be thinner; this would minimize the shadowing and step coverage problems associated with point source deposition.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Measurements
\begin{itemize}
\item Observed metallic silver film color on wafer after evaporation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Week 10: Metal Definition} \\
Batch Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Having too high of a temperature can cause the silicon to diffuse into the aluminum contacts. As a result, spikes can form inside the source and drain. If these spikes go all the way through the heavily doped source/drain into the silicon substrate, the device is dead.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item One way to avoid this is to have 1\% silicon already diffused in the aluminum before evaporation. This causes the aluminum to reach its solid solubility limit and won't allow more silicon to diffuse in creating spikes.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Individual Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item  Severe misalignment of the METL mask could result in the failure of the metal layer to fully fill the contact holes.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Aligned to the CONT key and accounted for any misalignment with Vernier scales.
	\end{itemize}
\item Failure to completely etch through the metal could result in shorted devices.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Did not terminate etch until color change across the wafer completed.
	\item Agitated wafer during etch to avoid trapped air bubbles.
	\end{itemize}
\item Jammed wafer in photolithography machine during alignment, resulting in slight fractures along the edges of the wafer. This could result in more severe fractures due to elevated mechanical stress during future steps.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Took care to avoid placing further stress on the wafer while handling it during etching and sintering.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Measurements
\begin{itemize}
\item  3 $\mu$m line widths were recorded before and after etching. (2 $\mu$m lines were not visible due to poor resolution).
\item Vernier bars were recorded after etching.
\item Observed shift in color as aluminum layer was etched.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Week 11: MEMS Structure Release} \\
Individual Processing Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Failure to fully clear away sacrificial oxide will result in non-viable MEMS devices.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Overetched for process latitude to account for thickness variation
	\end{itemize}
\item Due to relative thinness of the polysilicon layer used in this lab, MEMS devices are liable to collapse upon release, particularly due to surface tension if a wet etchant is used. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Use of a dry etchant to remove sacrificial oxide. (Not done in lab).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Measurements
\begin{itemize}
\item No measurements taken. (MEMS release presumed to be unsuccessful in lab).
\end{itemize}

The surface concentration used here is $N_B = 8\e{14}$ according to the silicon wafer resistivity. Junction depths for pre-diffusion and drive-in were calculated in Appendix \textcolor{blue}{\ref{sec:jdepth}}. For field oxide, the junction depth used was the amount of silicon consumed when growing the field oxide ($(0.46)(477\text{ nm}) = 219 \text{ nm}$). For poly and gate oxide, we calculated ($(0.46)(86.5) = 39.8$ nm) of silicon that got consumed during gate oxide growth. Therefore a junction depth of $219 + 39.8 = 258.8$ nm.

Refer to Figure \textcolor{blue}{\ref{fig:jdepth}} for vertical and lateral junction depths. For details on the junction depth calculations see Appendix \textcolor{blue}{\ref{sec:jdepth}}. Also the reason we use a box approximation for the pre-diffusion is because we have a constant source profile. However, for drive-in we now have source-limited diffusion.

The profiles were all created in Tsuprem-4 using the EE143 process flow and verified by hand calculations.

\item[5) Lateral diffusion under the MOSFET gates. You may estimate. Justify estimation.
(Theoretical). (2 points)]
Using the data calculated in Appendix \textcolor{blue}{\ref{sec:jdepth}}, we see that for pre diffusion $N_0 = 10^{21}/\text{cm}^3$ and $N_B = 8\e{14}/\text{cm}^3$. Now we will use figure 4.10a [1] in the textbook and note that $N_B/N_0 \approx 10^{-7}$. Since our data goes off the graph in the figure, we will make an approximation that every multiple of 10 decrease in $N_B/N_0$ results in a vertical and lateral junction depth increase of 0.5. Using this approximation we get a vertical junction depth of 4.3 and a lateral depth of 3.8. This gives us $3.8/4.3 = 0.88$. Now from our earlier junction depth calculations we see that pre diffustion resulted in a depth of 365 nm. Thus $(365)0.88 = 321$ nm lateral junction depth for pre diffusion. For drive-in we have the same values of $N_B$ and $N_0$, but our junction depth here increased by 1000 nm. Thus $(1000)0.88 = 880$ nm. See Figure \textcolor{blue}{\ref{fig:jdepth}} for a tabular form of the data.

\section{Questions}
\begin{description}[style = nextline]
\item[1) What type of photoresist (positive or negative? I-line or G-line?) do we use in the
lab? What do I-line and G-line refer to? Briefly describe how the resist responds
to the process steps like spinning, UV light exposure and development.]
The lab uses positive photoresist. The lithography machine uses a light that has g line wavelength. The I and G lines refer to the wavelength of the light coming off the light bulb that reacts with the photoresist. G line is roughly 436nm wavelength and I line is 365nm wavelength. Photoresist is spun onto the wafer to spread it evenly over the wafer, but extreme topology and surface debris can cause excess PR in some areas and deficient PR in others. When exposed to UV light, the photo-sensitive part of the polymer activates changing it into an organic acid, whereas unexposed PR remains unchanged. When dipped into the PR developer, the organic acid form of the PR dissolves whereas the polymer form remains on the wafer, leaving a layer PR that masks certain areas of the wafer.

\item[2) What is the purpose of baking the wafers at 120 $\degree$C before depositing HMDS? What
is the purpose of the 90 $\degree$C bake after spinning on photoresist? What happens if the
soft bake is too hot and too long (say 120 $\degree$C, 5 minutes)?]
The purpose of baking the wafers at 120$\degree$C before depositing HMDS is to remove excess environmental moisture that has accumulated on the wafer. The purpose of the 90$\degree$C bake after spinning on photoresist is to evaporate the solvent and make it less sticky. If the soft bake is too long, the photoactive component of the PR may start to decompose and the PR may become less soluable in the developer.  

\item[3) What is the purpose of hard bake? What happens if we skip this step? What may
happen if the bake is done at a temperature above 120 $\degree$C (say 200 $\degree$C)?]
The purpose of the hard bake is to cross-polymerize the PR, making it less permeable to chemicals, more adhesive, and physically harder. If this step is skipped, subsequent etching and similar steps have a chance of penetrating the PR, making the mask meaningless. If the bake is done at a temperature above 120$\degree$C, the PR will start to become brittle, resulting in cracks that would also make the masking step meaningless.

\item[4) We do lithography steps under yellow light only. What is the consequence if we
expose the wafers to fluorescent light before development? What if we expose
them to fluorescent light after development? Would red light damage your process?]
If the fluorescent light happens to be near the wavelength of the g-line, it will react with the photoresist and make it soluble. Since there is no mask over the wafer at that time, it will make all the photoresist souble which will cause the developer to remove all the photoresist. If it were exposed after developement, it will still make the remaining photoresist soluble, but since we have already done developement, there is no risk of the remaining photoresist coming off (unless we were to dip it in the developer again).

\item[5) What are the differences between wet and dry oxidation that lead us to use one for
the gate oxide and one for the field/intermediate oxide? What is the purpose of
annealing in nitrogen after oxidation?]
Wet oxidation has a higher growth rate but a tendency to create dangling bonds and a lower density oxide, making it more suitable for the thick field/intermediate oxide. Dry oxidation is much slower but creates a higher density oxide with fewer dangling bonds, making it more suitable for creating the thin gate oxide that is critical in device performance. The purpose of annealing in nitrogen is to allow the silicon atoms to diffuse and repair damage done by oxidization. 

\item[6) How do you determine etching time using theoretical etch rate in literature? List
two ways to determine etch time empirically from lab measurements, when you
etch the layers. (Hint: these methods include visual cues.). How close are the
experimental and the theoretically calculated values?]
Given a theoretical etch rate for a material, we would figure out the depth we want to etch and wheather the etch is anisotropic or isotropic. Knowing the depth we want to etch and a etch rate, we can calculate how long we would need to etch. A good way to determine etch time empirically is to look at the physical change on the wafer surface; this will most likely be a distinct color change across the wafer. A second way would be to measure line widths on the masks. You can measure a 2 $\mu$m before and after etching in order to determine how much you actually etched. In order to see how etch rates compare see Figure \textcolor{blue}{\ref{fig:fig31}}.

\item[7) Before n+ deposition (prior to SOG spinning), we clean in Piranha but not in HF.
Before gate oxidation, we clean in both. Why the difference?]
For n+ deposition, we are depositing PSG (a phosphorate-doped oxide) on top of the wafer for diffusion. The presence of a native oxide on the surface serves as a barrier material between the PSG and the silicon, preventing unwanted inter-diffusion effects. However, for growing a high-quality gate oxide, the poor-quality native oxide will adversely affect results, thus it must be removed with an HF dip.

\item[8) Why is 5:1 BHF (5:1 N$\text{H}_4$F:HF) used for etching features in the oxide while 10:1
BHF is used for cleaning and spin-on-glass stripping? Why buffered HF? ]
We use buffered HF because normal HF etches way too quickly and tends to peel off photoresist as well. Using buffered HF allows for more controllable and constant etching which allows for good process control. According to the process flow, spin on glass etches at 470 nm/sec in 10:1 BHF while thermally grown oxide etches at 100nm/sec in 5:1 BHF. If we had used 5:1 BHF for the spin on glass, it would etch way to quickly and be difficult to control.

\item[9) What would happen if we skipped the HF dip before metallization? ]
Skipping the HF dip before metallization would result in a thin layer of native oxide at the Al-Si interface, causing poor contact with the devices on the wafer.

\item[10) What is etch selectivity? ]
Etch selectivity is the relative difference in etch rates for given materials on the wafer. Ideally, the etch should be highly selective towards the material to be etched and thus etch it the fastest whereas other material, like the PR, should etch much more slowly.

\item[11) Why do we first use the roughing pump and then the diffusion pump when pumping
down the aluminum deposition system? Why must the foreline pressure be kept
below 100 mTorr?]
Since the diffusion pump cannot exhaust against atmospheric pressure, we must first turn on the roughing mechanical pump to sweep the majority of the air out of the system before turning on the diffusion pump. The diffusion pump and roughing pump have pressure limits of $10^{-7}$ Torr and 10 mTorr. The foreline valve connects the diffusion pump and the roughing pump. If the foreline pressure is not kept below 100 mTorr, the diffusion pump will not be able to compress incoming gas to its rated efficiency.

\item[12) What is the Al etchant composed of? What happens if you use it at room
temperature? What is the purpose of sintering? What will result if sintering step is
skipped? What happens if sintering temperature is too hot or too low?]
Al etchant has a composition of 80\% Phosphoric acid, 10\% H2, 5\% acetic acid, and 5\% nitric acid. It etches much more slowly at room temperature then at 50 degC. Sintering allows the aluminum and silicon to interdiffuse, resulting in a good contact, as well as allowing hydrogen to diffuse into the oxide and tie up dangling bonds. If the sintering step is skipped, the contact may be poor. If the sintering temperature is too hot, the eutectic Al-Si system will melt. If the sintering temeperature is too low, the contact resistance between the aluminum and silicon will be too high.


\item[13) Briefly explain the mechanism of Xe$\text{F}_2$ etching. Is the etch isotropic or
anisotropic? In an integrated CMOS/MEMS process, is there any consequence to
using KOH instead of Xe$\text{F}_2$ for etch?]
XeF2 gas is absorbed by the silicon surface, where it breaks down into xenon and fluoride gas. The fluoride gas reacts with the silicon to form SiF2 gas, and both the xenon and SiF2 gas are released back into the air. XeF2 etching is isotropic. Using KOH as an etchant instead of XeF2 has two consequences. First, it is anisotropic and therefore less efficient at undercutting the beam. Secondly, it is a wet etch and liquid etchants can cause the freed structure to stick to the substrate due to surface tension of the liquid while drying. 

\item[14) . What would happen if a thick oxide film was left on the wafers as it went into the
Xe$\text{F}_2$ etching step? ]
Since XeF2 is highly selective against SiO2, the structure would not be freed as the etchant would not be able to etch through the oxide film to the silicon below.

\item[15) Identify two of the 11 major processing steps that are unnecessary to fabricate a
functional oxide cantilever beam. Why are they unnecessary?]
Gate oxidation and S/D deposition are unnecessary to fabricating a functional oxide cantilever beam. The cantilever requires no gate so any gate oxide grown during this step must later be removed, and doping plays no part in the functioning of a cantilever device, so S/D deposition can also be skipped if fabricating a cantilever beam.

\section{Bonus Questions (up to 10 Points)}
\begin{description}[style = nextline]
\item[1) Simulate the 143 process flow in Tsuprem4 (8 points) (updated on 11/20/14, you
only need to simulate the NMOS LDD example available online (i.e., s4ex4a, -b, -
c.inp))]
I ran the files provided to us by Wei-chang on one of the eecs linux servers that had tusprem-4 installed. I only changed input/output directories in the script files to get them to work properly. Here is the resulting figure that is plotted after compiling and running the example NMOS.
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=325pt]{calcs/bonus1.png}
\caption{tsuprem4 generated NMOS example process}
\end{figure}

\item[2) Describe an alternate method for doing one of the process steps (i.e. LOCOS instead
of Field Oxide, Sputtering instead of Evaporation, etc) and the tradeoffs.]
When performing photolithography, projection printing can be used instead of contact printing as was used in the lab. Unlike contact printing, where the mask is directly in contact with the wafer for exposure, projection printing positions the mask at a distance from the wafer and utilizes multiple lens to focus light on a single die. Projection printing would have poorer resolution than that of the contact printing performed in lab. It would also be less desirable for creating MEMS devices due to the inability to expose large topographies. However, there would be less risk of contamination from direct contact with the mask for multiple exposures, and the single-die exposure does not require as small of a minimum mask feature size. As a result, projection printing would reduce mask costs and therefore be preferred in industrial settings.

\end{description}

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Oxide Thickness calculations}
\label{sec:oxide}
Film thickness calculation for oxides:
\begin{equation}
X_{ox} = \frac{0.5B}{B/A}\Big[\sqrt{1 + \frac{4}{B}(\frac{B}{A})^2(t + \tau)} - 1\Big]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{{X_i}^2}{B} + \frac{X_i}{B/A}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
B/A = D_o\me^{\frac{-E_a}{kT}} (\text{Use table 3.1 [1] to find }E_a \text{and } D_o) \\
B = D_o\me^{\frac{-E_a}{kT}} (\text{Use table 3.1 [1] to find }E_a \text{and } D_o) \\
t = \text{Time of oxide growth} \\ 
\tau = \text{Time of initial oxide growth already present} \\
X_i = \text{length of initial oxide growth}
\end{align*}

Example: Calculated oxide thickness of Intermed Oxide: \\
Given: 5 min dry oxidation at $1050\degree$C and 12 + 25 min wet oxidation annealing at $1050\degree$C, calculate oxide growth. \\

First we consider the 5 min dry oxidation. Using table 3.1 [1] for a $<100>$ Silicon, and using dry oxidation, we see that for the linear rate constant (B/A), $E_A = 2.00$ eV and $D_o = 3.71\e{6} \, \mu$m/hr. For the parabolic rate constant (B), $E_A = 1.23$ eV and $D_o = 772\, \mu$m/hr. \\ \\
Using an arrhenius equation where $k =$ Boltzmann's constant, and $T = $ temperature. 
\begin{align*}
B/A &= D_o\me^{\frac{-E_A}{kT}} = 3.71\e{6}\me^{\frac{-2.00*1.602\e{-19}}{1.38\e{-23}(1050\degree\text{C} + 273)}} = 0.0887 \mu\text{m/hr} \\
B &= D_o\me^{\frac{-E_A}{kT}} = 772\me^{\frac{-1.23*1.602\e{-19}}{1.38\e{-23}(1050\degree\text{C} + 273)}} = 0.0159 \,{\mu\text{m}}^2\text{/hr}
\end{align*}
Since there is no initial oxide here, $\tau = 0$,
\begin{align*}
X_{ox} = \frac{0.5B}{B/A}\Big[\sqrt{1 + \frac{4}{B}(\frac{B}{A})^2(t + \tau)} - 1\Big] = \frac{0.5 (0.0159)}{0.0887}\Big[\sqrt{1 + \frac{4}{0.0159}(0.0887)^2(\frac{5\text{min}}{60\text{min/hr}} + 0)} - 1\Big] \approx 7.11 \, \text{nm}
\end{align*}

Now after this dry oxidation, we have a 37 minute wet oxidation at $1050 \degree$C. Using table 3.1 [1] again, but this time using the constants that apply for wet oxidation,

\begin{align*}
{B/A}_{\text{wet}} &= D_o\me^{\frac{-E_A}{kT}} = 9.70\e{7}\me^{\frac{-2.05*1.602\e{-19}}{1.38\e{-23}(1050\degree\text{C} + 273)}} = 1.50 \mu\text{m/hr} \\
B_{\text{wet}} &= D_o\me^{\frac{-E_A}{kT}} = 386\me^{\frac{-0.78*1.602\e{-19}}{1.38\e{-23}(1050\degree\text{C} + 273)}} = 0.411 \,{\mu\text{m}}^2\text{/hr}
\end{align*}

This time we do have an initial oxidation time $\tau$ because of the dry oxidation we did in the previous step. Here $X_i$ is the oxide length we calculated for the dry oxidation growth,

\begin{align*}
\tau = \frac{{X_i}^2}{B_{\text{wet}}} + \frac{X_i}{{B/A}_{\text{wet}}} = \frac{0.00711^2}{0.411} + \frac{0.00711}{1.50} \approx 0.00488 \text{hrs}
\end{align*}

And finally our oxide growth is,
\begin{align*}
X_{ox} = \frac{0.5B}{B/A}\Big[\sqrt{1 + \frac{4}{B}(\frac{B}{A})^2(t + \tau)} - 1\Big] = \frac{0.5 (0.411)}{1.50}\Big[\sqrt{1 + \frac{4}{0.411}(1.50)^2(\frac{(12 + 25)\text{min}}{60\text{min/hr}} + 0.00488 \text{hrs})} - 1\Big] \approx 386.3 \, \text{nm}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Junction Depth Calculations}
\label{sec:jdepth}
Junction depth calculation for box approximation (limited-source diffusion):
\begin{equation}
x_j = 2\sqrt{Dt \ln{(N_o/N_B)}}
\end{equation}
and for a half gaussian (constant-source diffusion):
\begin{equation}
x_j = 2\sqrt{Dt}\erfc^{-1}{(N_B/N_o)}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{align*}
D &= D_o\me{\frac{-E_A}{kT}} \,\,\text{(Diffusion coefficient)} \\ 
t &= \text{time of diffusion} \\
N_B &= \text{Background impurity concentration} \\ 
N_o &= \text{Surface concentration limited by solid solubility}
\end{align*}

Example: Calculate the junction depth after pre-diffusion and drive in. \\
According to the process flow [5], our silicon wafer has a resistivity of about 14-16 ohm-cm. From the same process flow we know that we had a phosphorus doped, solid solubility limited constant diffusion at $1050\degree$C. Using figure 4.6 [1] we see that at a temperature of $1050\degree$C our phosphorus surface concentration $N_o \approx 10^{21}$/$\text{cm}^3$. Now using the Resistivity of our wafer and figure 4.8 [1], we see that we have an impurity concentration $N_B \approx 8\e{14}/\text{cm}^3$. \\ \\
Using table 4.1 [1], we can calculate our diffusion coefficient. Note that pre-diffusion was done at $1050\degree$C for 5 minutes.
\begin{align*}
D &= D_o\me{\frac{-E_A}{kT}} = 10.5 \,\text{cm}^2/\text{sec}\,\, \exp{(\frac{-3.69*1.602\e{-19}}{1.38\e{-23}(1050 + 273)})} = 9.11\e{-14} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{sec}
\end{align*}
Now we can plug everything into our solid solubility limited box approximation equation:
\begin{align*}
x_j = 2\sqrt{Dt}\erfc^{-1}{(N_B/N_o)} = 2\sqrt{(9.11\e{-14})(300\text{sec})} \erfc^{-1}{(8\e{14}/10^{21})} \approx 365 \,\text{nm}
\end{align*}

Now for drive-in we kept the temperature the same, $1050\degree$C, but kept the wafer inside the furnace for 37 minutes (2220 seconds). Also we can no longer assume a simple box approximation, we must use a half gaussian; this means that our surface concentration is going to change with drive-in. \\\\
We will use the following equation,

\begin{equation}
N_B = (Q/\sqrt{\pi D_2t_2})\exp{(-(\frac{x_j}{2\sqrt{D_2t_2}})^2)}
\end{equation}

where Q is the does rate,
\begin{equation}
Q = 2N_o\sqrt{D_1t_1/\pi}
\end{equation}

Combining the two equations and noting that $D_1 = D_2$ because we are using the same temperature, $1050\degree$C, for both pre-diffusion and drive-in ($t_1$ is the pre-diffusion time and $t_2$ is the drive in time),

\begin{align*}
N_B = (2N_o/\pi)\sqrt{\frac{t_1}{t_2}}\exp{(-(\frac{x_j}{2\sqrt{D_2t_2}})^2)}
\end{align*}
Solving this for $x_j$ yields,
\begin{align*}
x_j = 2\sqrt{D_2t_2\ln{\big((2N_o/\pi N_B)(\sqrt{t_1/t_2})\big)}} = 2\sqrt{(9.11\e{-14})(2220)\ln{\big((2(10^{21})/\pi (8\e{14}))(\sqrt{300/2220})\big)}} \approx 1000 \,nm
\end{align*}

\subsection{Dopant Profiles.}
\label{sec:dopefiles}
According to the EE143 process flow, There was an initial blanket implant of B11 3E12$\text{cm}^{-3}$ on our $<100>$ wafer. Also our wafer had a resistivity of 14-16cm which corresponds to a background concentration of about 8E14$\text{cm}^{-3}$. Now for the field oxide, we used 5-80-5 minute dry,wet,dry oxidation to create about 500 nm of oxide. Putting all this information into Tsuprem-4 generates the plot in Figure \textcolor{blue}{\ref{fig:doping1}}. \\ \\
