Evaporation

Heat a metal (eg, al, Au) to the point of vaporization

Vaporized metal impinges onto the Si substrate, farming a film - kind of like a spray.

Do this under vaccum for better control of film composisiton

=================================
       
 joule heating to get this filament up to high temperature.
 - use tungsten
 
 
- Hang aluminum staples on filament (@@@@)

***step 0 - pump down to vacuum -- reduce film contamination & allows better thickness control

Al vapor will evaporate onto wafer in straight line vector paths evenly across

mean free path \lambda = kT/(sqrt(2)*pi*P*d^2)

P = pressure
d = diameter of gas molecule
k = boltzman constant
T = temperature

\lambda can be about 60m for a 4 Angstrom particle

E-4 Pa = 0.75 uTorr

***step 1 - Heat W filament -> melt Al, wets filament due to surface tension

***step 2 - Raise temperature more -> evporates the Al
